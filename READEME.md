# Jenkins-Breakfast-Box

I sit in my pajamas with an hour before work starts and all I want to do is setup a basic Jenkins server for my php project so that I can analyze the kerfluffle out of it. Screw waisting time figuring out how to setup a [chef server](https://github.com/pietervogelaar/chef-cookbook-jenkins-server) or [anisble away](https://github.com/HanXHX/ansible-jenkins-php) just to figure out what the [CRAP](http://www.crap4j.org/faq.html) is going on with my codebase. All I want is to input some commands to install and update my php jenkins box while eating some delicious php [pancakes](insert image link here).

## The requirements

You thought that this was just going to be a Download And Analyze (DAA) project, but you are mistaken! To run the jenkins breakfast box we still need to install some dependencies:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  * Make sure to download the latest version, even if you already installed VirtualBox before.
  * As of writing this my version (AOWTMV) is 5.1.14
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  * AOWTMV is 1.8.6
* [A Computer](http://i.giphy.com/xTiTnJ3BooiDs8dL7W.gif)

## The process

To run the breakfast box simply go to your terminal, clone the repository, and run vagrant up:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/fufu70/jenkins-php-box
$ vagrant up
```

After the breakfast box "up"s it will give some instructions as to what to do next:

> You Installed and updated jenkins ... YAY! Now run 'vagrant ssh', and in the '/home/vagrant/' dir go to run 'sudo bash install-jenkins/install.sh'

Dont tell me what to do Vagrant! Im my own well adgusted programmer! I know what i'll do:

```shell
$ vagrant ssh
$ sudo bash ~/install-jenkins/install.sh
```

Yea! I dont need no program telling me what to do ...

> Ok! So now go to your browser and view this IP address at port http://192.168.205.20:8080 and setup your jenkins machine

What is this! More [instructions!](http://i.giphy.com/X7jENDat6V5Je.gif)

After you make your own goddam decisions you adult you'll see a screen that requests you Unlock Jenkins
![alt text](:unlock-jenkins)

All you need to do is run

```shell
$ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

And copy and paste get the password shown on screen.

You then come up to a screen that requests you to Customize Jenkins, choose the highlighted "Install suggested plugins" option
![alt text](:customize-jenkins)

Afterwards it will install a list of generalized selection of plugins
![alt text](:plugins-installing-jenkins)

Once all fo the plugins arre finished installing we will go to setting up the first admin user, dont forget your username and password, we'll need it later.

JENKINS IS INSTALLED!~!~!~ 
![alt text](:installed-jenkins)

Now we go back to our handy dandy terminal to run some more [commands](http://i.giphy.com/JIX9t2j0ZTN9S.gif)

U should still be in the vagrant machines shell, if not run:

```shell
$ vagrant ssh
```

OK! So all we gotta do is run 3 more commands and we should be done with shell. These commands go to install some more [php specific plugins](https://github.com/fufu70/jenkins-php-box/blob/master/install-jenkins/plugins.sh), local [php tools](https://github.com/fufu70/jenkins-php-box/blob/master/install-jenkins/php-tools.sh) that the plugins will interface with, and [create a job](https://github.com/fufu70/jenkins-php-box/blob/master/install-jenkins/integration.sh) to combine these plugins together.

The first command will be the the php tools installation.

```shell
$ sudo bash ~/install-jenkins/php-tools.sh
```

Then install the plugins to integrate with your tools. You will need to use your username and password for jenkins as it will connect with jenkins through a jenkins-cli.jar

```shell
$ sudo bash ~/install-jenkins/plugins.sh
```

Once all of the plugins have been installed we want to be able to actually create a jobbo! Dont forget your username and password.

```shell
$ sudo bash ~/install-jenkins/integration.sh
```

Your done now, you should be anyways, When you go back to your running jenkins instance you should see your job just hanging out, php-breakfast. 

Ok, your work alarm has [rung](http://i.giphy.com/Tohtjw8GoSmpa.gif)! Get back to your [Hacking](http://i.giphy.com/MGaacoiAlAti0.gif) you filthy developer!

## Background Information

A basic jenkins environment for PHP codebases strictly for ubuntu-14.04. Its not fully automatic but is an aid in starting up the project simply using shell scripts to guide you along the way.
